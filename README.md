## Quick Start

### Option 1: Interactive Google Colab Demo (Recommended for Judges)

**Perfect for Video Demo and Judges!**

1. **Open the interactive notebook:** [interactive_demo.ipynb](interactive_demo.ipynb)
2. **Upload to Google Colab:** [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
3. **Upload your dataset** using the file uploader
4. **Run each cell step by step** to see the cleaning process
5. **Download your cleaned data** at the end

**What you'll see:**
- **Step 1:** Upload and examine your dataset
- **Step 2:** Data quality analysis with visualizations
- **Step 3:** AI-powered cleaning suggestions
- **Step 4:** Intelligent data cleaning process
- **Step 5:** Before/after comparison with charts
- **Step 6:** Download cleaned data and reports

### Option 2: Local Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Setup OpenAI API Key

1. Get your OpenAI API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Set it in `config.py`:
   ```python
   OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"
   ```

### Run the Complete Demo

```bash
python complete_demo.py
```

This will run all three demonstrations:
1. **Sample Data Cleaning** - Demonstrates basic cleaning capabilities
2. **WHO Health Data Cleaning** - Real-world health data processing
3. **Multi-Sheet Excel Support** - Advanced Excel file handling
